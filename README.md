## About

	As a (very) junior developer wanting to expand my horizons into functional languages, it seemed to me that Haskell was a good spot to jump into the deep-end of the pool. Having had experience with Scheme (a Lisp derivative) in the past, I found that I did not appreciate parsing through thousands of parenthesis when trying to parse through code.
	I chose to replicate a game largely because it seemed to be a fun, low commitment way to test out my knowledge of the programming language, with there being a relatively low bar for what can be considered an MVP. Additionally, Duck Hunt is a classic, simple game, and hopefully will not be too hard to implement.
	This project is currently in development, and if anyone has any tips for writing development-level Haskell, all input would be much appreciated!
